            <h4>Read quickly, Agent. There's no time to waste.</h4>
            <div>Three of the special extraterrestrial agent force are trapped on a precipice
                during an exhibition to retrieve the subject of study, the blomfargle. 
                The blomfargles have escaped captivity, but are willing to accompany us peacefully.
                However, our contacts have informed us that the blomfargles are also willing
                to turn on us, but only if they outnumber the agents (to ensure conquest). 
            </div>
            <div>
                <span class = "bold">Your mission</span>, agent, is to communicate with the extraterrestrial force and blomfargles.
                We have struck a deal with all parties; They will listen to your directions. Coordinate
                with all six into peacefully getting down from the precipice, with the hover car
                we have provided. The hover car has a maximum capacity of two, so be strategic.
            </div>

                <span class = "bold">The Spider(?)</span> 
                <p>
                    A unnatural predator that takes the form of a striped man-spider.
                    Is agiated by "clicking" sounds. Attacks indiscriminately. Avoid at all cost. 
                    Hover car is equiped with repellent. As long as the hover car is near
                    our agents, it will not appear there. 
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Click on a person or blomfargle to move them in and out of the hover car.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click on the hover car to move it across the precipice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People in the hover car count as part of the total people on the side that the hover car 
                        is on.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Remember not to let the blomfargles outnumber the humans!
                Good luck.
